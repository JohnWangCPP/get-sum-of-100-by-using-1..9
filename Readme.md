The code solves following problem:

Given an integer n between 1 and 9, write a function that returns all possibilities, where if you were to put either '+' or '-' or nothing (glue numbers together) between each number 1, 2, ..., n (in this order), so that the result of the arithmetic operation is always 100.

For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
